# HWiNFO_Implosion
My customized version of the Implosion themed rainmeter. 

This rainmeter is based on the Implosion theme by user Gordanj https://www.deviantart.com/gordanj/art/Implosion-153285159
Many modules are heavily modified to add support for a HWiNFO plugin that can read sensor data from the HWiNFO program.
Other modules like the VU meter are created from scratch and simply follow the 'implosion' theme and use it's theme resources.
